# AI-Driven Chatbot for Intelligent Document Analysis

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to analyze documents and generate concise summaries while answering user queries intelligently. The system can process text files, PDF documents, and web URLs, extract relevant content, and provide context-aware responses using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The main objective is to reduce manual effort in reading and analyzing large documents by automating information extraction and summarization.
